# yantrad — working notes

**Nothing is implemented. This is the M0 skeleton**, and the most useful thing you can do here is
not write code before M4 needs it.

Scoped to this crate; the root [`CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md) still binds.

## What it will be

The control-plane daemon. Every client — CLI, web UI, hardware panel — talks to this and nothing
else; **no client ever talks directly to a managed machine.** It will own machine inventory,
workspace definitions, session state and placement.

## What is already decided

- **The logic is not written here.** `yantrad` becomes an HTTP surface over
  [`yantra-core`](../yantra-core/CLAUDE.md), which already holds the orchestration. If a handler is
  about to contain a decision, that decision belongs in the library, where the CLI can reach it too
  ([ADR-0005](../../docs/adr/0005-core-logic-in-a-library-crate.md)).
- **The CLI is the honesty check.** Anything the web UI can do must be expressible in `yantra`
  first. That is what stops the daemon growing a second, richer API that the CLI cannot reach.
- Stack when it starts: `axum` for HTTP and WebSocket, `tokio` throughout, `rusqlite` *only if*
  state genuinely cannot be derived from tmux — prefer deriving (Y-044, which has receded twice).
- **Never store secrets.** Workspaces hold references; the daemon resolves them at launch and never
  writes a value to SQLite, a log, the API, or a terminal stream (root §B4).

## Before writing anything here

M4 is the milestone that needs it. Read [`tracker.md`](../../tracker.md) first — the daemon's shape
depends on decisions that are still open, including the telemetry ADR (Y-020) and whether a session
store is needed at all.
